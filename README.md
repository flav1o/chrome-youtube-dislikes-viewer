# YouTube Dislikes Extension
----
It's not great that now we can't see the dislikes from a video, anyways... I made this extension so you can check them back. 
Since i don't have money to buy a youtube api subscription you will have to get your own api key, it's free, don't worry!
You just have to paste it in the config.js file.

## How to install it
You just have to download/clone this repo. After that you just have to go to chrome settings > extensions and upload this extension. 

## Search dislikes for a video
You will have to copy the video id, but what is it?
```https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ```
The video id is what comes after the "watch?v=" in the URL, so copy the "dQw4w9WgXcQ" and paste it into the extension search bar. And there you go, you now can check the video dislikes.

## Errors 
If your video ID is invalid, the api won't return anything so there isn't going to be displayed any data.
